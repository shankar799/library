This is a Java Full Stack Application which I used Spring for Backend, React for Frontend,Okta for Authentication and MySQL for Database.

This is a library application in which you can login with credentials which we create from Okta after logging we can search books and also check it out maximum 
we can check out 5 days and if we want extra days for the book we can also renew it and after reading the book we can return it and also if we want to contact
library services for adding any book or reporting any complaints we can do that too and if we login as the admin we can see that reports or msgs and reply to them.

I am attaching all the source codes and running scripts to run the application.

Happy Coding :)
